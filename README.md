# Computer Networks Exercises @HTW Berlin

Computer Networks (lab exercises) is an introductory course to computer networks. It is part of the bachelor in applied computer science at HTW Berlin (Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin <https://ai-bachelor.htw-berlin.de/studium/aufbau-des-studiums>).

This course uses several operating systems to show that the theory is applied in different tools very similarly. Therefore we use freeBSD as the main operating system as it is pretty well documented and just works. Furthermore we use Arch Linux, Cisco IOS (as a popular vendor for networking equipment, even though they often lack good security controls).

### The course contents includes:

 1. Basic shell and UNIX usage & basic computer network hardware
    * Basic commands, navigation in the FS
    * In- & Output redirection, Piping
    * UNIX DAC, permissions
    * vi & vim, SED, AWK, grep
 2. Setting up simple network (IPv4, IPv6)
    * Usage of network interface adminstration via net-tools amd iprout2
        * Analysis of existing network configuration
        * Determine configuration (static or via DHCP)
    * Pure switched network
        * Setting up ip addresses, netmask etc. for switched LAN
        * Advantage of IPv6 link local addresses for LAN usage
    * Simple routing
        * setting up simple Linux router
        * usage of routes and routing tools
